**Contributions**
Our team—Heytt, Diya, and Daksh—worked together to bring Stackit to life during the hackathon. We collaborated closely, leveraging our collective skills to design, develop, and polish the project under tight deadlines. Below is a breakdown of our contributions:

Heytt, Diya, and Daksh (Collective Work): We teamed up to architect the core functionality of Stackit, including the design and implementation of the application's main features. Together, we handled the setup of the tech stack, built the core logic, and ensured smooth integration of components. Our collaborative efforts covered coding the backend and frontend, managing version control, and testing the application to ensure it met the hackathon’s requirements.

Diya (Individual Contribution): Diya stepped up as our bug-busting hero in the final hours. She tackled critical last-minute bugs, debugging complex issues in the codebase to ensure the application ran smoothly for the demo. Her quick thinking and attention to detail were key to delivering a polished product.

We’re proud of what we accomplished as a team and had a blast building Stackit! If you have any questions or want to dive into the code, feel free to explore the repository or reach out.
